# Hear Me Out

Tired of the usual AI project hype? So are we.

Most AI-themed tokens out there are a stretch at best—mostly human-driven projects with AI names slapped on top. Even those leveraging tools like Claude or other AI companions still rely heavily on manual input and human creativity to function. That’s where we’re different.

We’re putting the **AI** back in **AI-driven projects**.

With this project, nearly every element—the **code**, **token name**, **ticker**, **image**, and even this **README**—was created by AI, with minimal human intervention. We simply let AI do its thing, no micromanaging involved.

## What Sets Us Apart?

Leveraging **OpenAI** APIs, we generated:
- The **project code** 
- A full **deployment script**
- Token **metadata** (Name, Symbol, Image)
- This **README** document!

The only input we provided was a high-level prompt: an animal-themed **memecoin** that’s unique but still built with financial growth in mind. That’s it! From there, the AI handled everything.

This project stands out for its true AI-centric design, bypassing the human-heavy approach most projects rely on. The result? A fresh, unpredictable, and verifiable AI creation.

## Proof of AI-Generated Content

To verify, head to the **Actions Tab** on GitHub, where you’ll find evidence of the AI-generated workflow. Yes, even the deployment and workflow scripts were generated by AI through OpenAI.

No gimmicks—just pure AI-driven development. **Get in early, this is the real deal.**

### Key Features:

- AI-generated **token name**, **ticker**, and **image**
- Utilization of **OpenAI** and **Claude** for metadata and workflow creation
- Fully automated deployment with minimal human input
- Transparent, verifiable AI-generated process via **GitHub Actions**
